I'm a Frontedn Developer, Data Analyst, and Graphics Designer who currently works as a freelancer. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, web development, data analytics and engineering...
I create technical content (on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkbrandful/),  build useful [open-source projects](https://github.com/brandStunner), speak at some meetups/conferences...
**Here's a quick summary about me**:
ðŸ˜Š I used to criticise poor web apps and design, but now I criticise with compansion, and building to avoid being criticised! 
I accidentally fell into an analytics role, filling in the gap using excel, and ended up building useful insight and engineering data for analysis with Python, SQL(MySQL, MSSQL), PowerBI and Azure. Now stuck in that loop.
Used to be bias towards the popular JavaScript or Python debate, now I enjoy both knowing how powerful both are in different phases of development ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ’™ Mere mortal who switches between "I'm Super Genius" and "I know nothing afterall" based on code manipulations
