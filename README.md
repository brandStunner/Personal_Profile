I'm a Geologist at heart, and a Data Analyst. I'm all into making meaning out of data and that means I occasionally play around messy information to get useful data out of it.
I occasionally share technical content (on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkbrandful/), build useful [open-source projects](https://github.com/brandStunner), speak at some meetups/conferences...
**Here's a quick summary about me**:
ðŸ˜Š I love to get accurate data and information, so I keep stacking my skills up to make sure I channel out what I'd expect from others 
Frequently, I am either on a wrangling and modelling spree in excel, making analysis or automating in Jupyter, delving into and finding answers from some SQL database, building some dashboard with PowerBI to relay some insight or something geology related! Seldomly, I go and polish my JavaScript to update my personal portfolio

ðŸ“« Building on old stacks, learning new ones

ðŸ’™ Mere mortal who switches between "I'm Super Genius" and "I know nothing after all" based on code manipulations
